# üö¶ Intelligent Traffic Signal Controller Using Vehicle Count  

An AI-powered traffic signal control system that adapts green light duration dynamically based on real-time vehicle count at intersections. This system leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** and **OpenCV** for vehicle detection and applies decision-making rules to optimize traffic flow.  

This project is specifically designed for **Indian traffic conditions**, considering the unique challenges such as mixed traffic (cars, bikes, auto-rickshaws, buses, trucks) and high congestion at intersections.

## üìå Project Description  
Urban traffic congestion is one of the major challenges in smart cities, especially in **India**, where traffic involves a variety of vehicle types and unpredictable patterns. Traditional traffic lights operate on fixed timers, which often leads to inefficiencies, such as long waiting times and unnecessary delays.  

This project introduces an **Intelligent Traffic Signal Controller** that:  
- Detects **Indian vehicles** (cars, two-wheelers, auto-rickshaws, buses, trucks, etc.) in real-time using **YOLO + OpenCV**  
- Counts the number of vehicles in each lane  
- Dynamically adjusts **green signal duration** based on traffic density

By doing so, the system improves traffic flow, reduces congestion, and minimizes idle time at intersections ‚Äî making it suitable for **Indian urban roads**.
